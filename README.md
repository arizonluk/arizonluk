  I am from Turkey 🇹🇷 well organized, creative and insightful. My interests and range of work is in the Crypto World, especially Node Running, and all of our time is spent running/testing nodes. I am always open to new ideas and opportunities. And I like to help projects develop in the early stages to implement everything planned, as well as support the finished products of projects.
🔭 I am currently working on different kind of support tools for projects.

👯 I am looking to collaborate with projects on testnet/mainnet.
